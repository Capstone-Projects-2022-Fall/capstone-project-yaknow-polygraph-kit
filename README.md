# yaKnow Polygraph Kit
### Project Overview

The yaKnow Polygraph Kit is an improvised and alternative polygraph device used by an examiner to measure physiological responses of an examinee while the examinee is asked a series of questions. After the measurements are collected and recorded, the examiner interprets the collected data set to determine if the examinee was engaging in deception during question. The indicators being measured by the yaKnow Polygraph Kit:  
- Respiration Rate
- Pulse 
- Skin Conductivity 
- Blood Pressure

After the examination has been completed, timestamps of questions asked will be used in conjunction with timestamps of the examineesâ€™ collected physiological indicators to create a singular graph. Analysis will be conducted on this graph to aid the user in making an informed decision on whether or not the examinee was engaging in deception during any part of the questioning process.
